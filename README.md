- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sapphirris, Street names Robert or Sapphire. Pronouns are presentation dependant (but I won't hurt you for messing them up)
- 👀 I’m interested in games development, learning spoken languages
- 🌱 I’m currently learning programming and development in Unity, and C#. Learning to speak and read Dutch and Japanese.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
- 📫 How to reach me ...

Gripes I want to find a solution to:
 - github / github desktop doesn't properly detect moved files (and instead deletes and re-adds them in commits).
 - github desktop hides it's git version from unity (and everything else?) would be more useful if it wasn't. (and had some more advanced features for mentoring other people.
